# The official slashkudos GitHub App

Build team morale by giving kudos to your teammates directly from issues, pull requests and discussions.

## Getting started

1. Install the slashkudos app on your repository
2. Start giving kudos! For example: `/kudos to @philip-gai for your first contribution! ðŸŽ‰`
3. slashkudos will respond with how many total kudos the user has received
4. View your kudos on [app.slashkudos.com]!

## What kudos will be public?

Kudos given on public repositories will be displayed on [app.slashkudos.com]. Kudos given on private repositories will NOT be displayed on [app.slashkudos.com] to avoid sharing private information.

## Next up

We plan to add support for connecting your GitHub account to [app.slashkudos.com] so you can easily see all kudos given in your orgs, teams and private repositories in one place.
